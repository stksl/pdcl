Common Type System:

The language is fully translated into CIL and thus CLS-compliant 
```c
boolean - bool

uint8 - Byte
uint16 - unsigned short
int16 - short
uint32 - unsigned int
int32 - int
uint64 - unsigned long
int64 - long

single - float
double - double

char - char
string - string
```


To use external assemblies, make sure to reference them in ".config.json", you can either use a full or a relative path
```
    "ReferenceAssemblies": ["../asm1.dll", "full/path/asm2.dll"]
```
